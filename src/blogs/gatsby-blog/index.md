For a long period of time, I was searching for an engine to host and maintain my first technical blog, from a developer perspective you can imagine what am I searching for? I would like to find an engine that satisfies my technical desire, an engine that I can extend it, I can develop on top of it using the most lovely language in this planet, the ECMAScript aka Javascript.

So, with a previous experience used a .net open source blog engine, I wasn't happy with the final result after a lot of investigations and extending it, I stopped using it but it still exists on the internet!

More than 2 years working with ReactJS, GatsbyJS was the perfect option for me to choose it for publishing my first technical blog.

## What is GatsbyJS?

From my perspective it is an engine that built with Graphql and ReactJS technologies and accept many different types of data sources, so you can make your source like JSON files, markdown file like my case, calling APIs and so on.

Gatsby is a static site generator, believe or not you can build a website in just five minutes especially if you start with a starter project and that what happened with me. I used gatsby-starter-blog and I extend it with some functionalities and adapt it to satisfy my needs like the following,

- Dark / Light theme feature.
- styled-components feature.
- Tweaking Graphql queries.
- Create Shared components to use it normally across the project.
- SEO.
- Share posts on Social media feature.

## Who am I?

Hamed Farag with you, a front-end engineer at ITWORX, worked with many different technologies starting from .Net Web Forms, .Net MVC, SQL Server, Sharepoint 2010, knockout, AngularJS to ReactJS, Redux, SASS, styled-components.

So you might expect to see in the future posts about front-end technologies and its ecosystem.
