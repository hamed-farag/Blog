In the [last post](/front-end-env-p1), of how to build your front-end environment, we talked about how to convert your machine to a front-end one using infrastructure applications, like Node.js and python, What are the utilities that you can use, some tips and tricks to make your development process easier. 

In this post we will mainly talk about the text editors, so be ready.

### What is the text editor?

A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software, following the naming of Microsoft Notepad. Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor)

Some editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses. With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor)

### Editor War!

In the past few years, some editors rised to our world, you can say from 2014 till today, some text editors like Atom and Visual Studio Code still in the fight and the war still going on.

I know there are some other editors like Brackets, Sublime and notepad++, but I think Atom and VS Code are very awesome editors.

### What is my choice?

My first text editor when i was .Net Developer as I remember was Visual Studio 2008 and by the way it is not a text editor, it is something called IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 

#### What is IDE?

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Most of the modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. [Wikiepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).

An IDE, on the other hand, needs to be able to edit text and, depending on the definition, have:

- An integrated compiler and/or interpreter — whether it is an or, or an and depends on the language, of course. For example, a Python IDE will have an integrated interpreter for Python while a C/C++ IDE will have an integrated compiler.
- An integrated debugger.
- Autocompletion features — giving you hints as to how to finish a line of code.
- Linting features — telling you what, if anything, is wrong with each line of code.
- Function list — a list of functions defined in your program, often with a little of variables that have been defined. Usually these lists are interactive, you can click on a function and it will take you to the definition, with the same being true for variables and their definitions.

You may Wondering and ask a question? My Text editor doing all the these features so what is the different between them?. Yes your text editor will be a fully-fledged IDE if you install the right packages and extensions into your text editor.

**Back Again**, what is my current IDE or text editor? i like **Visual Studio Code** and i wokring on it scince mid-2016 till now. I tried to work with Atom but honstly i wasn't comfortable to work with it.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also customizable, so users can change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. The source code is free and open source and released under the permissive MIT License. The compiled binaries are freeware and free for private or commercial use.

Visual Studio Code is based on Electron, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code)

Lets start to convert Visual studio code from text editor to A powerful IDE.
